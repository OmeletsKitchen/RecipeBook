    180 grams all-purpose flour
    2 tsp baking powder
    1 tsp kosher salt
    ¾ tsp ground turmeric
    224 grams sugar
    12 grams finely grated lemon zest
    30 ml lemon juice
    170 grams Greek yogurt
    2 large eggs
    113 grams unsalted butter
    
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9 by 4-inch loaf pan (see Note) with nonstick cooking spray or butter, and line it with parchment, leaving some overhang on both of the longer sides so you're able to easily lift the cake out after baking.
2. Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, and turmeric in a medium bowl.
3. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of the sugar with the lemon zest and rub together with your fingertips until the sugar is tinted yellow and smells like you just rubbed a lemon in there. Whisk in the yogurt, eggs, and the lemon juice until well blended.
4. Using a spatula, add the wet mixture to the flour mixture, stirring just to blend. Fold in the melted butter. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top. Scatter the top with the lemon slices and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar.
5. Bake until the top of the cake is golden brown, the edges pull away from the sides of the pan, and a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 50 to 60 minutes. (I love deeply caramelized lemon, but if they're getting too dark, lay a piece of foil on top to prevent burning.) Let cool before slicing.
