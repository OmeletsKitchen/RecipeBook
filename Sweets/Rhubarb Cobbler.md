## Ingredients

    4 c. Chopped Rhubarb
    1 1/2 c. Sugar
    1/4 tsp. Salt
    2 tbsp. Lemon Juice
    1/2 tsp. Almond Extract (optional)
    2 c. All-purpose Flour
    2 tbsp. Sugar
    1/4 tsp. Salt
    1 tbsp. Baking Powder
    1/4 c. Vegetable Shortening Or Lard
    1/4 c. Butter
    1/2 c. Whole Milk
    1 whole Egg

* Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

* In a bowl, combine rhubarb, sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, lemon juice, and almond extract if using. Stir and set aside.

* In a separate bowl, combine flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and baking powder. Stir together. Add shortening and butter, then cut together with a pastry cutter.

* Beat egg and milk together. Pour into flour mixture and stir with a fork until just combined.

* Pour rhubarb into a buttered baking dish. Tear off pinches of dough and drop it onto the surface of the fruit, creating a "cobbled" texture. Sprinkle additional sugar over the top.

* Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden brown and bubbly. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream.
