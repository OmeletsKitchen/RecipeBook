The berries:

    747 grams fresh blueberries
    66 grams sugar
    7 grams all-purpose flour

The dough:

    180 grams all-purpose flour
    ½ tsp kosher salt
    18 grams sugar
    2¼ tsp baking powder
    84 grams cold unsalted butter
    178 grams heavy cream
    
Preparation

1. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. To prepare the berries, place in a bowl and toss with the sugar and flour. Set aside.
    
2. To make the dough, mix the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder in a bowl. Cut in the butter until mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the cream and mix lightly, just until the dry ingredients are moistened.
    
3. Put the blueberries in a 1 1/2-quart gratin or baking dish. Make patties out of the dough, 2 to 2 1/2 inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick. Arrange them over the top of the berries. Bake until the topping is brown and the juices bubble thickly around it, about 35 to 40 minutes.
    
4. Let cool slightly. Serve warm, with cream to pour on top, if desired.
