Ingredients

    2 lb Taro, cut into large cubes (Be sure to get large taro, not the baby ones!)
    Â½ cup tapioca pearls
    5 cups water
    1 (13.5oz) can coconut milk, shaken very well
    100g rock sugar or 75g granulated sugar, plus more if you prefer sweeter sago

Method:

Cook Tapioca Pearls

1. Fill a pot with 5 cups of water. Bring to a boil.
2. Once the water boils, reduce the heat to a simmer and add the tapioca pearls. Cook the pearls for about 15 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent sticking.
3. After about 15 minutes, the pearls should look translucent. Turn off the heat and cover the pot with a lid. Let the pearls sit for another 10-15 minutes before rinsing the pearls.
4. Once the sago pearls are cooked and translucent, remove from heat and strain them through a fine mesh sieve and rinse off the excess starch with cold running water.
5. Fill a separate large bowl with cold water. After rinsing, transfer the cooked pearls to cold water to cool them down. Set aside.

Taro Coconut Sago

1. In a large pot, add taro cubes, rock sugar, and water. I added about 5 cups of water, just enough to cover the taro cubes. Adjust the amount of water depending on the size of the pot you are using. All taro cubes should be covered by water.
2. Bring water to a boil, then reduce down to a simmer. Let is simmer for about 20 min, under taro is soft. To check to see if the taro is cooked or not, use a fork and chopstick and stick it into a taro cube. It should go in easily.
3. Add coconut milk and cook for another 5 minutes. Taste and add more rock sugar is you desire.
4. Drain tapioca pearls and add to the taro coconut soup. Stir and serve hot or cold.
