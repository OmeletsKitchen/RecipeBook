For Muffins

    360g all-purpose flour
    200g sugar
    2 tbsp poppy seeds
    1 tbsp baking powder
    1/2 tsp baking soda
    1/2 tsp salt
    340g plain whole milk yogurt or low-fat yogurt
    2 tbsp fresh lemon juice, optional
    2 tbsp grated lemon zest
    2 large eggs
    112g unsalted butter, melted and cooled

For the Glaze

    50g sugar
    59g lemon juice
    coarse sugar for sprinkling, optional

Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees F. Grease 12-cup muffin tin.
2. Whisk flour, sugar, poppy seeds, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk yogurt, lemon zest, and eggs until smooth. Gently fold yogurt mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Fold in melted butter. Do not overmix. If you overmix, the muffins will be dense.
4. Divide batter evenly among prepared muffin cups. (I like to use this ice cream scoop to make it easy) Bake until golden brown and toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Rotate muffin tin halfway through baking.
5. While muffin are baking, simmer sugar and lemon juice together in a small saucepan over medium heat until it turns into a light syrup, about 3-5 minutes.
6. Remove muffin tin to a wire rack. Brush with lemon syrup. Sprinkle with coarse sugar. Let muffins cool in tin for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool for another 10 minutes before serving.
