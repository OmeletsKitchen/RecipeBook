Cookies:

    113 grams softened butter
    200 grams granulated sugar
    2 eggs
    1 tbsp milk
    2 tsp baking powder
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    ½ tsp salt
    300 grams all-purpose flour
    
Icing:

    330 grams powdered sugar
    3 tbsp water
    1 tbsp corn syrup
    2 tsp vegetable shortening
    ½ tsp vanilla
    
Method:

1. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until lighter in color. Add in the eggs, one at a time, mixing just until combined and scraping the bowl down as needed.
2. Add in the milk, baking powder, vanilla and salt.
3. Start adding in the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing until the dough is soft but not sticky.
4. Refrigerate the dough for 20-30 minutes.
5. Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone liners.
6. Sprinkle a counter with flour. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on the floured counter. Roll the dough until it is 1/4” thick, using extra flour as needed.
7. Use cookie cutters to cut shapes, then transfer to the prepared cookie sheets, keeping the cookies about 1 inch apart.
8. Re-roll any dough and cut into shapes, adding flour as needed.
9. Bake the cookies, one sheet at a time, for about 8 minutes, or just until set. Do not overbake.
10. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely.
11. To make the icing, combine the powdered sugar, water, corn syrup, vegetable shortening and vanilla in a bowl and beat well. The icing should be a little bit stiff.
12. Start by placing half of the icing in a piping bag fitted with a small round tip. (You can also use a ziplock bag and cut a very small hole in the corner but it’s much easier with a piping bag and tip.) Pipe the outside shape of the cookie. This acts as a dam so that the icing doesn’t drip off the sides.
13. To the remaining icing (and you can add back in any icing that didn’t get used from piping the edges) add a little more water. Start small, about a teaspoon at a time, and stir. You want a thinner consistency that is easy to spread, but you don’t want it too runny. Using a spoon (or another piping bag), put some icing in the middle of the cookie. Using the back of the spoon, spread the icing to the borders that were piped on earlier. The border should keep the icing from spilling over. If using sprinkles, sprinkle the cookie while the icing is still very wet.
14. Leave the cookies in a single layer until they are completely dried. Once dried, you can stack the cookies.
