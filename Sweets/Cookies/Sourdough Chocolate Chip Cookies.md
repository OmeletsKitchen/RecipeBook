# Ingredients
## Dry Ingredients

    ¾ cup + 1 teaspoon (95 g) all-purpose flour
    1 cup + 1 teaspoon (125 g) bread flour (all-purpose can be substituted, see notes)
    1 teaspoon (5 g) fine sea salt
    ¼ teaspoon baking soda
    ½ teaspoon baking powder

## Wet Ingredients 1

    1 large (1 ) egg
    ½ cup (125 g) sourdough starter discard
    1 teaspoon (5 g) vanilla extract

## Wet Ingredients 2

    8 tablespoons (113 g) unsalted butter (cold, cubed)
    ½ cup (100 g) light brown sugar
    ½ cup (100 g) white granulated sugar
    1 ½ cups (340 g) chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)
    
# Instructions

## Mix dry ingredients

    Use a whisk or a fork to mix the bread flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt in a small bowl. Set aside.

## Mix wet ingredients 1

    In a separate small bowl, use a whisk or a fork to beat the egg, vanilla extract and sourdough starter until smooth. Set aside.

## Mix wet ingredients 2

    Place the cold, cubed butter, light brown sugar and granulated sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment. Beat on low-speed until the mixture forms small crumbles, 45-60 seconds. Add the chocolate chips and mix on low-speed 30-45 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
    Add the dry ingredients and mix on low-speed until the batter starts to become a crumbly mixture, 20-30 seconds. Pour in the egg mixture and mix on low-speed until the dough comes together and starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl, 20-30 seconds. Use a spatula to stir the batter, ensuring all of the ingredients have been fully incorporated.
    Use a cookie scoop to portion the dough into 12 balls, (2 scoops per cookie) and place them on a parchment lined baking tray. Chill the dough in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours. (24 hours is best!)
    Bake in a preheated, 375°F (190°C) oven for 15-17 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the center still appears slightly under-baked. Remove and allow the cookies to rest on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring them to a cooling rack.

## Notes

    Store baked cookies at room temperature in an air-tight container for up to 7 days. Place a small slice of white bread inside the container to help keep cookies fresh.
    Freeze unbaked dough for up to 3 months. 
    Bread flour can be replaced with equal parts all-purpose flour. Using 100% all-purpose flour will produce a less chewy cookie.
