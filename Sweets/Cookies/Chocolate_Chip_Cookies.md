    250g sugar
    269g brown sugar
    284g slightly softened butter
    2 tsp vanilla extract
    3 large eggs
    510 g all purpose flour
    2 tsp baking soda
    1/2 tsp salt

1. Preheat oven to 375F.
2. In the bowl of a food processor, cream together butter, vanilla, eggs, and both sugars until fluffy.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, chocolate chips, and salt. Mix with wet ingredients just until combined, taking care not to overmix.
4. Use a cookie scoop to make dough balls and place on parchment paper, leaving plenty of room between each cookie.
5. Bake 8-11 mins (11 works best for me) or until golden brown.

*Coating the chips with flour helps them distribute more evenly, especially if you use a stand mixer to combine your dough.
