    281g flour
    1.5 teaspoons baking soda
    2 teaspoons ground ginger
    2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
    1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    170g unsalted butter
    100g brown sugar
    50g granulated sugar
    80g dark molasses
    1 egg
    2 teaspoons vanilla extract

1. Whisk flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt together and set aside.
2. in a large bowl whip butter and both sugars together to make a paste. About 2 min on stand mixer with paddle attachment. Add molassess and beat. Then add egg and vanilla and beat again.
3. On a low speed mix in dry ingredients slowly. After mixing cover and chill for at least 1 hour and up to 3 days.
4. After chilling preheat oven to 350F.
5. Let dough slightly warm for 30 min at room temp. Then scoop out dough balls and roll in granulated sugar. Place on a baking mat or parchment paper lined baking sheet before placing into oven.
6. Bake for 12-14 min. Taking out the sheet and giving it a gentle bang near the end may help with cracking, it didn't for me.
7. Remove and let slightly cool on the baking sheet before moving to a wire rack to finish cooling.
