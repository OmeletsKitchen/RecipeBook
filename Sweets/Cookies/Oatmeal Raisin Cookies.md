    1 cup/227 grams (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, more for pans
    1 cup/200 grams dark brown sugar, packed
    ⅓ cup/66 grams granulated sugar
    2 large eggs
    1 tablespoon/15 milliliters vanilla extract
    1 ½ cups/187 grams all-purpose flour
    ¾ teaspoon salt
    1 teaspoon baking soda
    1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
    ¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
    ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom or ground ginger
    3 cups/270 grams rolled oats (not instant)
    1 ½ cups/225 grams raisins
    
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter two large cookie sheets, or line them with parchment paper or reusable silicone liners.
2. Using an electric mixer, beat butter in a large bowl until creamy. Add brown and granulated sugars, then beat until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated. Then, beat in vanilla extract.
3. In a separate bowl, use a wooden spoon or spatula to mix together the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom. Set mixer on low speed, and beat flour mixture into the butter mixture. Stir in oats and raisins.
4. Spoon out dough by large tablespoonfuls onto prepared cookie sheets, leaving at least 2 inches between each cookie.
5. Bake until cookie edges turn golden brown, about 9 to 13 minutes. Centers will still be quite soft, but they will firm up as the cookies cool. Cool completely on a wire rack. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

*For the few, the brave, the naughty; soak the raisins in dark rum while you prepare the dough. Add the raisins and the remnants of rum as the final step.
