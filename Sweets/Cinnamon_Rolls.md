Dough:

    2¼ tsp 1 package yeast
    237 ml warm milk
    100 grams sugar
    56 grams softened butter
    2 eggs
    2 tsp vanilla
    ½ tsp salt
    510 grams flour

Filling:

    95 grams brown sugar
    12 grams cinnamon
    60 grams butter, melted and cooled

Frosting:

    60 grams cream cheese, room temperature
    42 grams butter, room temperature
    90 grams powdered sugar
    
1. In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast into the warm milk. Add the sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla and salt. Stir until mixture is combined.

2. Add the flour to the bowl and stir in until combined.
   
3. Dust a work suface liberally with flour and turn out the dough (it will be very sticky). Sprinkle the dough with more flour and knead the dough until it is able to be formed into a ball.
   
4. Spray a bowl with cooking spray and add the dough. Cover and allow to rise for 1 1/2-2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.

5. Preheat the oven to 400F.

6. Re-flour a work surface and roll the dough into a large rectangle, approximately 16 x 20. Spread the melted butter over the dough surface.

7. Combine the brown sugar and the cinnamon in a small bowl, then sprinkle over the butter. Roll up the dough from the long side. Cut the dough into 2" lengths.

8. Line a 13 x 9 baking pan with parchment paper and place the dough rounds in the pan. Place in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, until the rolls are puffed up and slightly golden.
    
9. While the rolls are in the oven, beat the cream cheese and butter together using a hand mixer. Mix in the powdered sugar, and beat until smooth. Ice the rolls while they are still warm.

*Note: Baking time has been increased and frosting/ filling amounts have been halved based on my experience with the original recipe.
