Cupcake ingredients

    1 & ⅓ (165g) cup all-purpose flour
    1 & ½ tsp (6g) baking powder
    ¼ tsp (1g) salt
    ½ cup (114g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
    1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
    1 large egg
    ¼ cup (60g) Greek yogurt (plain or vanilla)
    ¾ cup (188ml) cold milk (buttermilk is best, but any kind works)
    2 tsp (10ml) vanilla extract

Buttercream ingredients

    ¾ cup (170g) unsalted butter, room temperature
    1/4 tsp (1g) salt
    seeds of 1 vanilla bean (or 1 tsp vanilla extract)
    3 cups (375g) powdered sugar
    2–3 tbsp (30-45ml) cream or milk

Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350F and line a muffin pan with 12 paper liners.
2. In a large bowl, toss together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the melted butter and sugar. Then mix in the egg, yogurt, cold milk, and vanilla.
4. Add the wet ingredient to the dry ingredients. Whisk until just smooth and combined.
5. Using a 1/4 measuring cup, divide the batter into the 12 cupcake liners.
6. Bake for about 20-22 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let cool completely before frosting.

For the buttercream:
1. Using a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or handheld mixer, beat the butter, salt, and vanilla bean seeds until light and fluffy.
2. Add in the powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, mixing well in between. Add in the cream or milk, 1 tablespoon at a time as needed.
3. Beat on high speed for about 1 minute after the last addition of powdered sugar for a fluffy and airy texture. Frost the cupcakes as desired.
