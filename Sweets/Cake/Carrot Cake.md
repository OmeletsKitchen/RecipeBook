## Cake Ingredients

* 2 cups (260g) chopped pecans (1 cup for cake, 1 cup for garnish. Nuts are optional. )*
* 1 and 1/2 cups (300g) packed light or dark brown sugar
* 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
* 1 cup (240ml) vegetable oil or canola oil (or melted coconut oil)*
* 4 large eggs
* 3/4 cup (133g) smooth unsweetened applesauce
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 2 and 1/2 cups (312g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
* 2 cups (260g) grated carrots (about 4 large)

## Cream Cheese Frosting

* 16 ounces (450g) full-fat block cream cheese, softened to room temperature
* 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
* 4 and 1/2 cups (540g) confectioners’ sugar (Start with half this and add more to taste)
* 1 Tablespoon (15ml) heavy cream or milk
* 1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* pinch of salt, to taste

## Make the Cake

* Preheat oven to 300°F (149°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Spread the chopped pecans on the sheet and toast for 7-8 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10-15 minutes.

* Turn the oven up to 350°F (177°C). Grease two or three 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.

* Whisk the brown sugar, granulated sugar, oil, eggs, applesauce, and vanilla together in a large bowl until combined and no brown sugar lumps remain. In another large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves together. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and, using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, fold the ingredients together until just combined. Fold in the carrots and 1 cup of the toasted pecans. (The rest of the pecans are for garnish.)

* Pour/spoon the batter evenly into the cake pans. If using three cake pans, bake for 20-24 minutes. If using two cake pans, bake for 30-35 minutes. Test the center with a toothpick. If it comes out clean, the cakes are done. If not, continue to bake until cooked through. Do not over-bake. Allow the cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.

## Make the Frosting

* In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. 

* Add the confectioners’ sugar, cream/milk, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes until completely combined and creamy. 

* Add more confectioners’ sugar if frosting is too thin, more milk if frosting is too thick, or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Frosting should be soft, but not runny.

*Note: This can be made in a bundt pan! Simply bake for 50 mins.
**Super Note: These can be made as cupcakes! Using the same recipe and oven temp, fill a muffin cup to the top and bake 20 mins without nuts, or 25 with, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
