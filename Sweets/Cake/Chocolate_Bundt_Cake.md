Ingredients

        218.75 g all-purpose flour
        90 g cocoa powder*
        2 teaspoons baking soda
        ½ teaspoon salt
        400 g caster sugar
        120 ml oil vegetable or canola
        2 large eggs*
        1 teaspoon vanilla extract
        120 ml buttermilk*
        120 ml sour cream*
        80 ml boiling water (or hot coffee)
        
1. Preheat the oven to 350F (180C) degrees and position a wire rack on the bottom ⅓ of the oven.
2. Brush a 12-cup capacity bundt pan with pan release* or grease and dust with cocoa powder. Be sure to get inside all the creases of the pan.
3. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, and sugar.
4. In a separate large bowl beat (or whisk) together the oil, eggs, vanilla extract, sour cream, and buttermilk.
5. Beat the flour mixture into the wet ingredients (I usually do this about ½ at a time).
6. Carefully whisk the boiling water into the batter.
7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and bake for 50-60 minutes - or until a toothpick comes out clean.
8. Cool in the pan for 20 minutes, then carefully invert the pan onto a wire rack to slide the bundt cake out. *Do not try to invert the pan immediately, or wait until the cake is fully cooled to invert.

*Note: You can make frosting to go with this cake, but it is so decadent on its own I highly recommend simply dusting with powdered sugar.
