Ingredients:

For the cupcakes:

    54g natural cocoa , sifted
    120g all purpose flour , spooned and leveled
    3/4 teaspoon baking soda
    1 teaspoon baking powder
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    56g unsalted butter , softened to room temperature
    1/4 cup (59ml) oil
    124g granulated sugar
    100g lightly packed brown sugar
    57g semi-sweet chocolate , melted and cooled to room temperature
    2 teaspoons vanilla
    2 large eggs*
    56g sour cream*
    159 ml buttermilk**
    59ml warm brewed coffee

For the buttermilk (because who has buttermilk handy, honestly)

    Place 2 tsp vinegar in a liquid measuring cup, then fill to 2/3 line with milk.
    Let sit 5 minutes until it curdles slightly, then proceed with recipe.

Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350F degrees and line 2 muffin pans with muffin papers.
2. In a medium sized bowl, whisk together the cocoa, flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
3. In a large bowl beat together the butter, oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar and melted chocolate on medium speed until light and fluffy. 
4. Beat in the eggs and vanilla, then turn down the mixer to low speed and mix in the sour cream. 
5. Slowly beat in the flour mixture followed by the buttermilk with the mixer on low speed.
6. Then, turn off the mixer and stir in the warm coffee with a large rubber spatula while scraping down the sides of the bowl.
7. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter into each cavity of the prepared muffin tin. Bake for 16-18 minutes until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. 
8. Allow cupcakes to cool in their pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to continue cooling.



Notes
**Ensure your eggs, buttermilk & sour cream are at room temperature before baking**

**The frosting is enough to make your teeth fall out of your head just by smelling it. These are perfect on their own.**
