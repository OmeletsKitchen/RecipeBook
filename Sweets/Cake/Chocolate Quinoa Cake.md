Ingredients:

    2 cups cooked quinoa
    78 ml milk
    4 large eggs
    2 tsp vanilla extract
    170 grams butter, melted and cooled
    300 grams sugar
    80 grams cocoa powder
    1 1/2 tsp baking powder
    1/2 tsp baking soda
    1/2 tsp salt

Method:

1. Preheat oven to 350F. Lightly grease 2 8-inch round or square cake pans. Line the bottoms with parchment paper.
2. Combine milk, eggs, and vanilla in a food processor. Add 2 cups cooked quinoa and the butter and continue to blend until smooth.
3. Whisk together the sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the contents of the food processor and mix well.
4. Divide batter evenly between the two pans and bake on the center oven rack for 40-45 mins, or until a knife poked in the center comes out clean.
5. Cool completely in the pan. Frost if desired.
