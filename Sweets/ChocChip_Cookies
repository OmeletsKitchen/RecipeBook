Ingredients:

    227g room temp salted butter
    100g white sugar
    285 g brown sugar
    2 eggs, room temp
    2 tsp vanilla
    1 tsp baking soda
    1 tsp baking powder
    3/4 tsp coarse salt
    330g all purpose flour
    1 bag chocolate chips
    
Heat oven to 360F. (Yes, you read right)
    
1. Cream butter and both sugars using a stand mixer at medium high speed for about 3 minutes, until fluffy.
2. Add eggs and vanilla and beat an additional 2 minutes.
3. Add dry ingredients and mix on low until just combined. Do the same for the choco chips.
4. Scoop out about 2tbs of dough per cookie, placing with plenty of room on a baking sheet.**
5. Bake 12-14 minutes, allowing cookies to set before relocating to a cooling rack (or your stomach)

**These cookies freeze amazingly well. At step 4, place dough on a sheet as normal, then freeze for about half an hour. 
Working in batches, fill a freezer bag with the lumps of dough. Freezing them before placing them in the bag prevents them from sticking together.
When ready to bake, heat the oven normally and bake at the same time and temp.
