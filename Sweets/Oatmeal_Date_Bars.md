Filling ingredients:

    120 grams chopped dates
    118 ml cup water
    50 grams sugar

Crust ingredients:
    
    150 grams quick-cooking oats
    120 grams all-purpose flour
    215 grams brown sugar
    1/2 teaspoon baking soda
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    75 grams butter, melted
    1 large egg white, room temperature

Method:

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°. Place dates, water and sugar in a small saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring constantly.
2. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, until thickened, about 5 minutes, stirring constantly.
3. In a large bowl, mix oats, flour, brown sugar, baking soda and salt; stir in melted butter and egg white.
4. Press half the mixture into an 8-in. square baking pan coated with cooking spray. Spread carefully with date mixture; top with remaining oat mixture.
5. Bake until lightly browned, 20-25 minutes. Cool in pan on a wire rack. Cut into bars.

Optional: Mix dry shredded coconut or almond slices into the crust for an extra treat; you may need 15 or so more grams of butter to compensate.
