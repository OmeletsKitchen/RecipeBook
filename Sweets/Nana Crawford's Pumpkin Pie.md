Ingredients

Crust:

    240 g flour
    170g butter, cold
    104 ml icewater

Filling:

    1 can raw pumpkin puree (about 2 cups)
    238 g brown sugar
    50g white sugar
    1 1/2 tsp cinnamon
    1/3 tsp nutmeg
    3/4 ginger
    1 tsp salt
    473 ml (2 cups) milk
    3 eggs
    1 tsp vanilla
    
Instructions
    
Preheat the oven to 400F while you work.

Crust:

1.Cut cold butter into small pieces, then blend with the flour in a stand mixer on low speed or with a pastry cutter until the dough becomes shaggy. 
2.Add icewater one tablespoon at a time until it becomes just soft enough to roll out. 
3.Move the dough onto a well floured surface and beat it into a mound with your rolling pin. 
4.Attempt to roll out the crust. If it seems reluctant, chill it in the fridge a bit and allow it to rest, then try again. 
5.After rolling it to 1/4in to 1/2in thickness, fold the crust over your rolling pin and carefully lay it overtop or a tart or pie tin. Push the dough into the corners, then roll the pin over the rim to neatly trim the edges (not recommended for a flimsy aluminum tin). Crimp edges to your liking.
    
Filling:

1.Beat all ingredients together thoroughly, until there are no lumps. A stand mixer with a whisk attachment or hand beater is perfect for this. 
2.You can warm the filling in a large saucepan to reduce baking time, or pour it directly into your unbaked crust.
3.Your oven should now be preheated to 400F. Place your pie onto a baking sheet to catch any spills, and carefully place it in the oven. 
4.Immediately turn the oven down to 325F.
5.Bake the pie, starting to check for doneness after an hour. It may take up to 1 3/4 hours. The pie will be done when it stops sloshing in the center as you jiggle the baking sheet.
6.When it's done, pull the whole sheet out and allow it to come to room temperature before serving. It's even better refrigerated, though allow it to become room temp 
before sticking it in the fridge unless you want a lake on top of it.
