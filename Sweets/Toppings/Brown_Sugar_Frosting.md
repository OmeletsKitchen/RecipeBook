Ingredients:

    53 g all-purpose flour
    305 g milk
    1 ½ tablespoons pure vanilla extract
    341 g salted butter at cool room temperature
    330 g brown sugar packed
    Pinch of salt

Method:

1. In a small saucepan, whisk flour into milk and heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens. It will be the consistency of a thick paste.
2. Remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.
3. Stir in vanilla.
4. 1 ½ tablespoons pure vanilla extract
5. While the mixture is cooling, cream the butter, sugar, and salt together until light and fluffy on medium high, about 3 minutes.
6. Add the completely cooled milk mixture.
7. Beat it for about 5 minutes on medium-high to high until it looks like whipped cream. If you can still taste the sugar granules, keep beating it until you can’t.
