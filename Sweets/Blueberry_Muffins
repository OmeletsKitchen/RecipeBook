Ingredients:

    112g butter, melted and cooled
    2 large eggs, room temperature
    118 ml milk, room temperature
    250g all purpose flour
    2 tsp baking powder
    150g white sugar
    1 tsp salt (omit if using salted butter)
    425g blueberries
    2 tsp vanilla extract
    
    Instructions:
    
    Set oven for 375F.
    
    1. Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder and set aside.
    2. In another bowl, mix eggs, sugar, milk, and vanilla until smooth.
    3. Rinse your berries, drain thoroughly, and dump onto a kitchen towel. Gently pat dry.
    4. Combine the wet and dry ingredients, gently mixing until combined.
    5. Gently fold in blueberries, taking care not to crush them.
    6. Pour into a muffin tin (I like to sprinkle a oatmeal in the bottom). A 1/3c scoop is perfect for this.
    7. Bake 25-30 minutes until a knife comes out clean.
