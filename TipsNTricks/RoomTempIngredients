For butter:

1. Pour 2c water in a microwave safe bowl.
2. Microwave water for 2 mins until very hot. Meanwhile, cut butter into small pieces and put on a plate, ideally with space between each chunk.
3. Carefully remove water from microwave, and place butter inside as quickly as possible to avoid losing the steam.
4. Allow radiant heat to soften the butter, about 10 minutes.
