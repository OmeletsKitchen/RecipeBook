Better Basic Beans:
Keep a kettle of hot water nearby as you simmer to replenish the pot as needed. For more flavor, add any of these: large outer celery leaves; a Parmesan rind; woodsy herbs like rosemary, sage, and thyme; or a small dried chile. Extra bean-cooking liquid makes an excellent vegetable stock; it can be frozen in an airtight container for up to three months.

    1 pound dried beans, such as white, black, kidney, or pinto 
    1 small onion, peeled and halved through root end
    4 cloves garlic, peeled
    1 dried bay leaf
    Kosher salt 
    
1. Cover beans with 2 inches water; soak overnight in the refrigerator. 
2. Drain and transfer to a large pot or Dutch oven; cover again with 2 inches water. 
3. Add onion, garlic, bay leaf, and 2 teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer; skim and discard foam.
4. Cook, adding more hot water as needed to keep beans fully submerged, until tender and cooked through, about 1 to 1/2 hours, depending on type and freshness. 
5. Season to taste toward end of cooking. Remove and discard aromatics.
6. Let beans cool in cooking liquid, then refrigerate in cooking liquid in an airtight container up to 5 days, or freeze up to 3 months.
