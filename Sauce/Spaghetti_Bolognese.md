Ingredients:

    1 pound spaghetti (uncooked)
    2 tablespoons olive oil
    1 pound ground beef (extra lean)
    1 large onion (chopped)
    4 cloves garlic (minced)
    1 tablespoon oregano (dried)
    ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
    2 tablespoons tomato paste
    1 cup red wine
    28 ounces crushed tomatoes ((1 can))
    2 tablespoons basil (chopped)
    ½ teaspoon salt (or to taste)
    ½ teaspoon pepper (or to taste)
    ¼ cup heavy cream
    ½ cup Parmesan cheese (grated)
    2 tablespoons basil (chopped, for garnish)

Method:

1. Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions. Keep the pasta water, in case needed for sauce.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook for 3 minutes, breaking it as you go, until no longer pink.
3. Add the onion and garlic and cook for another 3 minutes until the onion softens.
4. Add the oregano, red pepper flakes, tomato paste and stir. Stir in the red wine and cook for about 5 minutes until most of the liquid has cooked off.
5. Add the crushed tomatoes, basil and season with salt and pepper. Stir and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a medium-low. Cover the pot and cook for about 20 minutes.
6. Stir in the heavy cream and adjust for seasoning if needed. If your sauce is too thick add some of the pasta water to thin it out.
7. Add the spaghetti to the pot and toss well with the sauce. Top with Parmesan cheese and basil. Serve immediately.
