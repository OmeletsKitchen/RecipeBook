Makes about 1.5 cups.

    1/2 cup soy sauce
    1/2 cup mirin (sweet rice wine)
    1/2 cup sake (Japanese rice wine)
    1/2 cup white sugar
    1/4 roughly chopped yellow onion
    5 thin round slices peeled ginger
    2 medium garlic cloves, smashed
    
Combine ingredients in a small pot, bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer. 
Simmer about 8 minutes so the aromatics can infuse their flavor.
Strain, discarding solids.

The sauce keeps in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
