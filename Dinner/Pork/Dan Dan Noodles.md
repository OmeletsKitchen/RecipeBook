Ingredients:

    2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil
    454g lean ground pork
    8 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
    2 Tbsp peeled fresh ginger, minced
    2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
    2 Tbsp brown sugar
    2 Tbsp red chile paste, preferable sambal oelek
    2 Tbsp hoisin sauce
    1/2 c soy sauce
    1/4 c dry white wine, such as a chardonnay
    4 c chicken broth
    454g dried spaghetti

    Shredded fresh cucumber, for serving
    Bean sprouts, for serving
    Minced cilantro, for serving


Method:

1. Set Instant Pot to saute. Warm the oil in the insert, then crumble in the pork and cook until browned, about 4 minutes.
2. Stir in scallions, ginger, garlic, brown sugar, chile paste, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, and wine, scraping up any fond at the bottom of the pot.
3. Pour in the broth and stir. Continue cooking until liquid is steamy, but not yet simmering.
4. Break spaghetti in half and lay in a crisscross pattern over the top of the broth.
5. Gently press the spaghetti into the liquid while ensuring it doesn't touch the bottom of the pot. Cook on HIGH for 6 minutes, then quick release when the cycle is complete.
6. Remove the lid, and switch the pot to Saute once more. Bring the noodles up to a simmer, stirring constantly until the sauce thickens.
7. Use hot pats to carefully remove the liner and set on a wire rack to stop the cooking. Serve warm with toppings.
