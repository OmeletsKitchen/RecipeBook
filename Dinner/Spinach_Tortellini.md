Ingredients:

    12 ounces cheese tortellini
    1 tablespoon olive oil
    3 cloves garlic, minced
    15-ounce can petite diced tomatoes OR 4-5 finely diced sun dried tomatoes
    3 cups spinach, roughly chopped
    1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
    ½ teaspoon salt
    ¼ teaspoon pepper
    1 ½ cups half and half
    ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

1. Cook the tortellini according to the package directions, drain, and rinse.
2. Heat the oil in the bottom of the large pot over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute, careful not to burn it.
3. Stir in the tomatoes, spinach, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the spinach has wilted, about 2 minutes.
4. Gradually whisk in half and half and Parmesan cheese, stir and cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is slightly thickened, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the tortellini to the sauce and gently toss to combine.
