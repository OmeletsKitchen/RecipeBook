    2 cloves garlic, minced
    1/2 a small onion, diced
    1 pound ground beef (OR turkey)
    8 ounces tomato sauce
    1/2 cup ketchup
    2 to 4 tablespoons brown sugar
    2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
    1 teaspoon prepared mustard
    1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
    Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
    Hamburger buns
    Sliced pickles
    
1. Set a large pot over medium-low heat. Add a few drops of extra-virgin olive oil, and saute the garlic and onions for a minute or two until just fragrant and very light golden brown. Add ground beef, increase heat to medium/medium high, and cook until no longer pink, breaking apart and stirring as meat cooks. Drain grease from meat.

2. While meat is browning, make sauce. In a medium bowl, stir together tomato sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, garlic powder, onion powder, and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, until well combined. Pour over browned meat, stir, and simmer for a few minutes until heated through (or longer, if you have time, to allow the flavors to meld).

3. Serve on hamburger buns or rolls with sliced pickles on top.
