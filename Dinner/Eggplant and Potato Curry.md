From: A slow cooker book at the library :( Sorry.

    2 eggplants, peeled, cut into d6 sized cubes, and sweated of moisture*
    2 Tbsp veg oil, divided
    2 potatoes, diced
    2 small or 1 large onion, finely chopped
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    1 Tbsp minced ginger root
    1 long chili pepper, minced
    2 tsp curry powder
    1/2 tsp salt
    1/2 tsp fresh black pepper
    1 Tbsp tomato paste
    1 c vegetable stock
    
1. In a nonstick skillet, heat 1 Tbsp oil over medium heat. Add sweated eggplant, in batches, and fry until browned. Transfer to slow cooker stoneware. Add potatoes to stoneware as-is.
2. Add onions to pan, adding remaining oil as necessary. Cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 min. Add garlic, ginger, chili, curry powder, salt, and pepper, and continue stirring for 1 min. Stir in tomato paste and veg stock. Pour mixture over the veg in the stoneware.
3. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours or high for 4 hours, until hot and bubbling. Resist the urge to stir too much.
4. Serve over warm rice.

*To sweat eggplant, liberally coat diced chunks with salt and place in colander above a sink. The moisture from the eggplant will drain out. After about 20-30 min, rinse eggplant briefly and continue with recipe.
