INGREDIENTS

Marinade:

    4 boneless chicken thighs
    1 cup (240ml) buttermilk
    1 tablespoon (10g) salt
    1 teaspoon (5g) sugar
    1 teaspoon (5g) MSG
    1 teaspoon (3g) fresh cracked black pepper

Dredge:

    1 ½ cup (240g) all purpose flour
    1 tablespoon (15g) fine sea salt
    1 teaspoon (3g) fresh cracked black pepper
    1 teaspoon (4g) garlic powder
    ½ teaspoon (2g) onion powder
    1 teaspoon (5g) MSG

    Cooking spray to coat chicken

METHOD

1. In a medium mixing bowl combine chicken thighs, buttermilk, salt, and pepper. Toss to coat evenly, and let marinate for at least 1 hour, ideally overnight.

2. Preheat your air fryer to 350°F (175°C)

3. In a separate medium mixing bowl combine all purpose flour, salt, pepper, and msg.

4. Drizzle a few tablespoons of your marinade into the flour mixture, and toss to create little balls of dredge. Remove one piece of chicken from the marinade, then toss and press your chicken into the dredge until each piece is fully coated. Repeat with the remaining chicken. Spray chicken with cooking oil before adding it to the air fryer.

5. Add your chicken to the air fryer and cook for 20 minutes at 350°F (175°C)
