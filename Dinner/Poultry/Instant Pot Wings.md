Yes, I'm serious- cooking the wings in the IP makes the meat fall off the bone tender. It's worth it! Plus- free broth!

Note: the sauce makes enough for one batch. We doubled the amount of wings and made a second type of sauce for some variety.

Ingredients:

    1 1/2 c water
    3 lb raw chicken wings

Buffalo sauce:

    1 cup hot sauce (I used thinned gochujang)
    3 Tbsp butter
    1 tsp Worchestershire sauce
    1 tsp sugar
    1 tsp garlic powder
    1 tsp black pepper, ground
    
    1 tsp cornstarch
    1 tsp water

Method:

1. Pour water into the IP insert. Stack the wings in the pot. It's ok if they stick out above the water line.
2. Cook on LOW (important!) pressure for 12 minutes, then quick release.
3. Carefully transfer the wings to a large bowl, or two, if making multiple flavors.
4. Strain and reserve the chicken broth for another use. Wipe out the IP insert, then replace it in the IP.
5. Turn on Saute mode and add remaining ingredients except for cornstarch and water. Stir the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl.
6. Cook sauce ingredients for about 3 minutes until bubbling. Add cornstarch slurry in a thin stream, stirring constantly until sauce is thickened.
7. Toss sauce with wings.

8. Optional: Lay sauced wings on a baking sheet and put under a hot broiler for 4-5 minutes each side, until cwispy.
