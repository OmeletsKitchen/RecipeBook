Spice Paste:

    1 tsp whole cloves
    1/2 tsp fennel seeds
    1/2 tsp cinnamon
    1 tsp chili powder
    1 tsp coriander seed
    1 tsp mashed ginger
    1/2 tsp garam masala
    salt, to taste
    3 cloves garlic

Ingredients:
    
    2 bay leaves
    2 Tbsp red curry paste (or 1 Tbsp for a milder curry)
    1 can coconut milk or cream
    1 large onion, diced
    1 large or 2 small tomatoes, diced
    1 Tbsp oil
    1/2 kg imitation or real (peeled) crab, broken into bite sized pieces
    fresh cilantro leaves, for serving
    
1. Grind all spices, ginger, and garlic cloves in a mortar and pestle to make a fine paste. Set aside.
2. Heat oil in a pan over medium high heat. Once the oil is hot, add your onion. A pinch of salt and sugar helps them brown nicely. Stir and cook until transluscent.
3. Add the spice/garlic paste and red curry paste, stirring to evenly coat the onion. Add tomato and cook until softened. You may need more oil to help it along.
4. Shake coconut cream vigorously before opening, then add to the mix, stirring to blend the sauce. Add your bay leaves and crab.
5. Bring to a low simmer, covered, for at least 10 mins.
6. Discard bay leaves. Salt and pepper to taste and top with cilantro leaves. Serve hot with white rice or bread.
