## Ingredients

* Kosher salt

* 3 large or 4 smaller bunches kale, any type (about 1½ pounds)

* 5 garlic cloves

* 1/4 cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling

* Freshly ground black pepper

* 12 ounces spaghetti, thick spaghetti, bucatini, or other long strand pasta

* Parmesan and crushed red pepper flakes (for serving)


## Preparation

Step 1

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, strip kale leaves from ribs and stems, then tear leaves crosswise into 2"–3" pieces. Cook kale in boiling water until bright green and slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, transfer kale to a colander and rinse under cold water, tossing; squeeze out excess liquid from leaves. Keep water at a boil (you’ll use it for the pasta).

Step 2

Whack garlic with the side of a chef’s knife to crush; peel off skins. Heat ¼ cup oil in a large heavy pot over medium. Cook garlic, stirring occasionally, until sizzling, about 3 minutes. Season very generously with black pepper and cook, smashing with a wooden spoon, until cloves break into rough pieces, soften, and look golden. Add kale to pot and cook, stirring often, until darkened in color and very tender, about 8 minutes (garlic will break into even smaller pieces). Season with kosher salt and pepper.

Step 3

Meanwhile, cook pasta, stirring occasionally, until very al dente (2–3 minutes less than package directions).

Step 4

Using tongs, add pasta to kale; splash in about 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Cook, tossing and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until sauce lightly coats pasta, about 2 minutes.

Step 5

Serve pasta topped with Parmesan, red pepper flakes, sea salt, and more black pepper.
