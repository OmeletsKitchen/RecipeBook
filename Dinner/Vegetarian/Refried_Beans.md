Ingredients:

    1 lb pinto beans, dry
    1 cup chicken broth
    1 teaspoon cumin seeds
    ½ cup finely chopped onion
    3 cloves garlic, chopped
    1 teaspoon paprika
    1 teaspoon smoked paprika
    2 teaspoons taco seasoning
    ½ finely chopped and deseeded jalapeno pepper
    1 tablespoon lime juice
    2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (plus extra for garnish)
    1 teaspoon salt + more to taste
    2 tablespoons olive oil
    4 cups water
    1 bay leaf

1. Set Instant Pot to saute mode. When hot add oil, cumin seeds and bay leaf. Let sizzle for about 30 seconds.
2. Next add the onion and jalapeno and saute for about 1 minute. Then add garlic, cilantro, paprika, taco seasoning and salt. Saute for 1 more minute.
3. Press cancel to stop the saute mode and add 1 cup of chicken broth. Scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to get up any stuck on bits. Add 4 cups of water and the beans. Secure lid and pressure cook on high for 45 minutes. Then do 20 minutes natural release.
4. Carefully remove lid, remove the bay leaf, drain liquid and set it aside (IMPORTANT!). Use an immersion blender or a potato masher and mash/blend the beans until the become smooth or desired consistency. Add the reserve liquid in batches until you get the consistency you like. The beans will thicken quite a bit so you’ll wind up using most of the reserve liquid.
5. Add any additional salt and the lime juice and serve with your favorite garnish.

*Note: I used cranberry beans in place of pinto and they are excellent. I soak them overnight to make them less farty.
