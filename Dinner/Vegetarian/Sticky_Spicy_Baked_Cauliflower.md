Sticky and Spicy Baked Cauliflower

4 SERVINGS Battering and oven-baking large cauliflower florets gives them a slightly crackly, just-rich-enough exterior that's ideal for coating in a sticky-sweet gochujang glaze.
Ingredients

    1 cup all-purpose flour
    ½ cup cornstarch
    2 tsp. baking powder
    1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt
    1 large head of cauliflower (about 2½ lb.), cut into large florets
    ¼ cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
    3 Tbsp. soy sauce
    2 Tbsp. pure maple syrup
    2 Tbsp. mirin
    2 tsp. unseasoned rice vinegar
    Steamed rice, toasted sesame seeds, and thinly sliced scallions (for serving)

Instructions

    Preheat oven to 400°. Whisk flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl to combine. Whisk in 1 cup water to create a thin pancake-like batter. Using your hand or 2 forks and working one at a time, dip cauliflower florets into batter, letting excess drip back into bowl, and divide between 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake cauliflower until edges are just beginning to turn golden brown, 20–25 minutes.
    Meanwhile, whisk gochujang, soy sauce, maple syrup, mirin, and 1 cup water in a medium bowl. Pour sauce into a skillet large enough to hold all of the cauliflower florets (a 12" skillet should do it) and bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking occasionally. Cook, whisking, until sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, 8–10 minutes. Stir in vinegar and remove pan from heat.
    Using tongs, transfer cauliflower to skillet with glaze and toss until florets are evenly coated in sauce.
    Divide rice among shallow bowls and spoon cauliflower over. Top with sesame seeds and scallions.
