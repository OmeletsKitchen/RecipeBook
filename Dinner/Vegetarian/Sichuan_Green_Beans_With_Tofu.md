# Charred Sichuan Green Beans & Tofu

I love ordering the garlicky charred green beans at our local Chinese restaurant, so it was only a matter of time before I got the itch to re-create the dish at home. As it turns out, a few fun spices, a sheet pan, and the broiler are all it takes! Firm tofu, which soaks up the spicy, salty sauce, is a natural pairing.
You can find Sichuan peppercorns and sambal oelek (a spicy, Southeast Asian chile sauce) in the Asian foods section at most well-stocked grocery stores.

**SERVES 4**

## Ingredients

- 2 pounds green beans, ends trimmed
- 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons canola oil
- Kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns, crushed
- 1 tablespoon sambal oelek
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
- 2 tablespoons capers, drained
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 3 tablespoons less-sodium soy sauce
- 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
- 1 (12- to 14-ounce) package firm tofu, drained (see tip below)
- ¼ cup chopped scallions, white and light green parts only

## Instructions

1.  Preheat the oven to broil, with a rack about 4 inches from the heat. Line a sheet pan with foil or mist it with cooking spray.
2.  Toss the green beans with 2 tablespoons of the canola oil and a pinch of salt on the prepared sheet pan and spread them out in an even layer.
3.  In a small bowl, mix together the remaining 2 teaspoons canola oil, the Sichuan peppercorns, sambal oelek, garlic, ginger, capers, sugar, soy sauce, and sesame oil until smooth. Drizzle half of the sauce over the green beans.
4.  Remove the heavy weight and paper towels from the block of tofu, then use a sharp knife to cut the block into 8 rectangles, between ½ and ¾ inch wide. Dredge each piece of tofu in the remaining sauce, then tuck the tofu pieces on top of and around the green beans on the pan. Scatter the scallions on top of the dish.
5.  Transfer to the oven and broil until the beans are good and charred, 4 to 6 minutes, flipping the tofu halfway through cooking.
6.  Serve hot.
