Ingredients:

    4 cups vegetable or chicken broth
    6 scallions, trimmed and cut into 1/2 in pieces
    4 celery stalks, cut into 1-inch pieces
    1/4 cup soy sauce
    2 Tbsp peeled fresh ginger, minced
    2 Tbsp oyster sauce
    2 Tbsp brown sugar
    2 Tbsp rice vinegar
    454 g dried spaghetti
    4 c savoy cabbage, shredded (half a cotes medium head)
    1 Tbsp cornstarch
    1 Tbsp water

Method:

1. Set the Instant Pot to saute. As the pot heats, pour in the broth. Stir in scallions, celery, soy sauce, ginger, oyster sauce, brown sugar, and rice vinegar until the sugar dissolves.
2. Break spaghetti in half and lay in a crisscross pattern over the top of the broth.
3. Manually cook for 4 minutes on HIGH. Quick release.
4. Use a fork to break up the noodles and stir into the sauce, then stir in the cabbage.
5. Turn on saute mode once more. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until the cabbage has softened and the liquid has been absorbed, about 2 minutes.
6. Which cornstarch and water in a small bowl until smooth and add in a thin stream, stirring constantly, until thickened. Serve warm.
