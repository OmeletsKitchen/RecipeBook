For the falafel:

    2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained
    1/4 cup fresh parsley
    1/4 cup cilantro
    2 cloves garlic
    1 large shallot, chopped
    3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
    2 tablespoons sesame seeds
    2 teaspoons ground cumin
    1 teaspoon paprika
    3 Tbsp lemon juice
    1 teaspoon salt
    Spray olive oil, for cooking

For serving:

    6 pita breads
    Fresh lettuce
    1 large tomato, sliced thinly
    1/2 red onion, sliced thinly
    1 cucumber, sliced thinly

Tahini Sauce:

    1/2 cup tahini (I like Joyva)
    1/4 cup Greek yogurt
    1/2 lemon, juice only
    2 tablespoons olive oil
    1/4 to 1/2 cup hot water

1. Make the tahini sauce: In a medium bowl, stir together tahini, yogurt, lemon juice, and olive oil. The mixture will be very thick to start. with hot water until it’s easily spreadable.
2. In the bowl of a food processor, add the chickpeas, parsley, cilantro, garlic, shallot, flour, sesame seeds, cumin, paprika, lemon, and salt. Pulse until mixture comes together in a rough paste. It shouldn’t be completely smooth.
3. Use a cookie scoop to measure the falafel mixture into balls. You should get 20-30 1-inch disks.
4. Spray the basket for your air fryer with some nonstick olive oil. Add as many falafel discs into the basket as you can without them touching and spray them with olive oil very lightly. Air fry the falafel at 350°F ̊ for 8 minutes. Flip and fry for another 6 minutes on the second side.
