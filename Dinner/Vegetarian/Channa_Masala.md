I know what you're thinking- you've had this before and it was watery or bland. Fuck that. MAKE THIS ONE!!

Ingredients:

    4 medium cloves garlic, roughly chopped
    1 (1-inch) knob ginger, peeled, roughly chopped
    1 to 6 green Thai chiles (to taste), roughly chopped
    2 tablespoons juice from 1 lemon, divided
    Kosher salt
    2 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee
    2 teaspoons black mustard seeds
    1 teaspoon whole cumin seeds
    1 large onion, finely diced (about 1 1/2 cups; 300 g)
    1/4 teaspoon baking soda
    2 teaspoons ground coriander
    1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
    1 1/2 teaspoons store-bought or homemade garam masala, divided
    1 (14-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
    2 (14-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
    1 cup cilantro leaves, roughly chopped

Method:

1. Combine garlic, ginger, chiles, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt in a mortar and pestle or in the small work bowl of a food processor and pound or process until a fine paste is produced. Set aside.
2. Heat oil or ghee in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. All at once, add mustard seeds and cumin. They will sputter and spit for a few seconds.
3. As soon as they are aromatic (about 15 seconds), add onion all at once, along with baking soda. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions start to leave a brown coating on bottom of pan, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon water, scrape up browned bits from pan, and continue cooking. Repeat this process until onions are a deep brown, about 10 minutes total.
4. mmediately add garlic/ginger/chile paste all at once and stir to combine. Add coriander, black pepper, turmeric, and 1 teaspoon garam masala. Stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes and crush them using a whisk or potato masher.
5. Add drained, rinsed chickpeas and cilantro, reserving a little cilantro for garnish. Add 1/2 cup water.
6. Bring to a simmer, cover with lid slightly cracked, and reduce heat to maintain a gentle bubbling. Cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has reduced into a thick stew and spices have melded, about 30 minutes.
7. Stir in remaining garam masala and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt. Serve with rice and/or naan, sprinkling additional cilantro on top.
