From: Oven to Table by Jan Scott

Ingredients:
    
    5 cloves garlic, peeled
    3-inch knob fresh ginger
    1 medium yellow onion, peeled and quartered
    2 Tbsp olive oil
    4 tsp curry powder
    1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
    2 tsp kosher salt
    2 Tbsp tomato paste
    2 540ml cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
    2 cups basmati rice
    1 400ml can coconut milk
    2 1/4 cups (560ml) water or vegetable broth
    chopped cilantro leaves, for garnish
    lime wedges, for serving

1. In a food processor, combine ginger, garlic, and onion and pulse into a chunky paste. Heat oil in a medium dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook the onion mixture, stirring frequently. Add spices, salt, and tomato paste and cook another 2-3 min, stirring constantly.
2. Add the chickpeas and rice to the pot and stir with a wooden spoon, thoroughly coating with the onion mixture. Pour in the coconut milk and water. Stir to combine and bring to a boil.
3. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 23-25 mins. Remove from heat, cover, and let rest for 10 minutes. Serve with cilantro and lime.
