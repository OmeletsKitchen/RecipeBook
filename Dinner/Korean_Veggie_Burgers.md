For the slaw:

    1/4 c mayonnaise
    2 c shredded red cabbage
    1/2 c shredded carrots
    
1. Squeeze as much liquid as possible from the kimchi for the burgers and transfer the liquid to a large bowl. Set drained kimchi aside.
2. In the bowl of liquid, add cabbage, carrots, and mayo. Give a pinch each of salt and pepper. Stir to combine, and stick in the refrigerator to chill.

For the grilled onions:

    1 medium onion, thinly sliced
    
3. In a skillet, heat 1 Tbsp oil over medium heat. Add sliced onions and cook, stirring often, until starting to brown, about 8 mins. Sprinkle with salt and pepper as desired. A pinch of sugar will help them carmelize well.
4. Transfer onions to a plate and wipe pan clean.
   
For the burgers:

    1 c kimchi
    1/4 c mayonnaise
    2 15-oz cans black soybeans or equivalent. DRAIN VERY WELL!
    1 large egg
    3/4 c panko
    1 Tbsp gochugaru
    2 tsp fish sauce
    8 burger buns

5. In a food processor*, add drained kimchi from step 1, as well as the beans, egg, panko, gochugaru, fish sauce, and mayonnaise. Pulse mixture a few times until coarsley combined. 
6. With damp hands, form the mixture into 8 4-inch patties (about 1/2 c each)
7. Heat 3 Tbsp oil in the skillet over medium heat. Add a few patties and cook until crisp, about 5 minutes (it should lift easily from the pan when ready). Flip and continue until the opposite side is crisp too.
8. Cook all patties in this way, transferring to a plate and covering the patties to keep them warm.
9. Toast buns, if desired
10. Assemble burgers with the slaw and grilled onions.

    
*This can also be done with a potato masher, but chop the kimchi and beat the egg before adding.
