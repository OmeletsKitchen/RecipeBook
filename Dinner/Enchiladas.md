Sauce Ingredients:

    3 tablespoons olive oil
    3 tablespoons flour
    1 tablespoon ground chili powder
    1 teaspoon ground cumin
    ½ teaspoon garlic powder
    ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
    ¼ teaspoon salt, to taste
    Pinch of cinnamon
    2 tablespoons tomato paste
    2 cups vegetable broth
    1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar
    Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

Enchilada Ingredients:

    4 cups refried beans, leftover pork, chicken, or beef, mushrooms, or a mix
    2 cups shredded Mexican cheese blend, divided
    ½ cup onion, diced
    1/2 cup jalapenos, seeded and diced, some set aside for serving (optional)
    12 (6 inch) corn tortillas
    Minced cilantro, for serving (optional)

Sauce Method:

1. Measure the dry ingredients into a small bowl and place it near the stove. Place the tomato paste and broth near the stove as well.
2. In a medium-sized pot over medium heat, warm the oil until it’s hot enough that a light sprinkle of the flour/spice mixture sizzles on contact. This might take a couple of minutes, so be patient and don’t step away from the stove!
3. Once it’s ready, pour in the flour and spice mixture. While whisking constantly, cook until fragrant and slightly deepened in color, about 1 minute. Whisk the tomato paste into the mixture, then slowly pour in the broth while whisking constantly to remove any lumps.
4. Raise heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, whisking often, for about 5 to 7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened a bit and a spoon encounters some resistance as you stir it. (The sauce will thicken some more as it cools.)
5. Remove from heat, then whisk in the vinegar and season to taste with a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. Add more salt, if necessary.

Enchiladas Method:

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.
3. Pour enough enchilada sauce onto a small plate to cover. Quickly dip both sides of one tortilla in sauce.
4. Spoon filling(s) and cheese down the middle, then wrap tortilla around filling.
5. Place into the prepared baking dish. Repeat to dip, fill, and roll remining tortillas.
6. Pour remaining enchilada sauce over filled tortillas and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling and cheese is melted, 35 and 40 minutes.
8. Allow to cool 5-10minutes before serving topped with diced jalapenos and cilantro.
