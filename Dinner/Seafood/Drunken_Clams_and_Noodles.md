**4 SERVINGS**

### Ingredients

- 4 5-oz. packages fresh ramen noodles or four 3-oz. packages dried ramen noodles
- 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil
- 1 2" piece ginger, scrubbed, thinly sliced
- 3 lb. clams (such as littleneck or Manila; about 36), scrubbed
- 3 red Thai chiles, thinly sliced
- 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 1 cup dry rice wine (such as michiu or sake)
- ¼ cup black or toasted sesame oil
- 2 Tbsp. oyster sauce
- 2 cups Thai basil leaves or 4 scallions, thinly sliced

### Instructions

1.  Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water (unsalted), stirring occasionally, according to package directions. Drain noodles, reserving 2 cups noodle cooking liquid; divide among bowls.
2.  Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium. Cook ginger, stirring often, until fragrant and lightly browned on both sides, about 4 minutes.
3.  Increase heat to high and add clams, chiles, garlic, wine, sesame oil, oyster sauce, and 1 ½ cups reserved cooking liquid to pot. Stir to combine, then cover and cook until clams open, 5–8 minutes. Uncover pot and remove from heat. Discard any clams that haven't opened. Stir in Thai basil. Taste broth and add more noodle cooking liquid if too salty or more oyster sauce if not salty enough. Ladle clams and broth over noodles in bowls.

*Note: YuChen favors michiu rice wine for a clean yet complex broth.*
