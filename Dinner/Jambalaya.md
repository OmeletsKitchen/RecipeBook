    6 slices bacon
    1 cup chopped onion
    1/2 cup chopped jalapeno
    1 teaspoon minced garlic
    1-1/2 cups diced, smoked ham
    1/2-pound andouille or other smoked sausage, sliced
    5 cups broth (ham broth works excellently if you have a hambone to use up)
    2 (15 ounce) cans black-eyed peas, drained
    2 cups uncooked, long grain rice
    1/4 cup sliced pickled jalapeno, chopped, optional
    1/4 cup sliced green onion
    1-1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste
    1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper, or to taste
    3 Tbsp Cajun seasoning (Slap Ya Mama recommended) or to taste
    1 medium bay leaf
    Chow Chow for garnish, optional
    Hot sauce, for the table
    
1. Using kitchen shears, cut the bacon into the bottom of a cast iron Dutch oven and sauté until slightly browned.
2. Add the onion and jalapeno; sauté for about 5 minutes until soft.
3. Add the garlic and cook another minute.
4. Add the ham and sausage and cook another 3 minutes.
5. Add the stock/broth and black-eyed peas; bring to a boil.
6. Stir in the rice, jalapenos and green onion. Season with salt, pepper, and Cajun seasoning. Add the bay leaf and return to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.
7. Remove from the heat and allow to sit covered for another 10 minutes before serving. Fluff with a fork.

*Note: Kidney beans work equally well here, either canned or cooked from dry.
