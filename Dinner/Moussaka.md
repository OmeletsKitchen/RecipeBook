## Method

### Ground Meat

* Place a pot over high heat and add the olive oil.

* Add the tomato paste and sauté so that it loses its bitterness.
* Add the chopped tomatoes, lower heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes until the sauce thickens.
* Remove from heat and add the parsley and coarsely chopped basil. Season with salt and pepper.

### For the béchamel sauce

* Place a pot over medium heat.
* Add the butter and let it melt.
* Add the flour and whisk until it soaks up all of the butter.
* Add the milk in small batches while continuously whisking so that no lumps form.
