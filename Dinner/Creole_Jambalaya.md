Ingredients:
    
    3 Tbsp olive oil (or oil of choice)
    1 medium onion, chopped
    2 large stalks celery, chopped
    1 medium bell pepper (any color, but I used red)
    4 Tbsp garlic, minced
    1 pound chicken breast, cut into ½-inch pieces
    9-10 ounces sausage, (link type) cut into bite-size medallions (andouille or any sausage of choice)
    1 tsp cayenne pepper (more or less to taste)
    2 tsp paprika (more or less to taste)
    salt to taste
    black pepper to taste
    1 tsp thyme , dry
    1 Tbsp oregano , dry
    1 Tbsp basil , dry
    1 can crushed tomatoes, undrained (28 ounces)
    3 cups chicken broth (or stock)
    1 cup rice, uncooked (I used Lundberg Jubilee, a wild mixed rice)
    ½ pound shrimp medium size, tail on or off, raw or cooked

1. Heat the oil on medium in a large Dutch oven on the stove top.
2. Add onion, celery, and bell pepper and cook about 5 minutes.
3. Add garlic, basil, oregano, and thyme and stir. Cook for about 5 more minutes.
4. Add the chicken and sausage and let brown for 5-10 minutes, stirring often.
5. Add cayenne pepper and paprika to the meat mixture and blend lightly.
6. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, chicken broth, and rice and mix. Bring to a light boil, then lower the heat to 1-2 and cover.
7. Cook covered on low for 45 minutes, stirring a couple times to make sure the rice isn't sticking to the bottom.
8. During the last 5-10 minutes of cooking, add the shrimp to the top of the mixture and cover. Check again after about 5 minutes and flip shrimp over, making sure not to cover it deeply so you can keep an eye on its doneness. Cover and cook 5 more minutes or until shrimp is opaque pink and white.
9. Serve right away with a side salad and crusty bread if desired.
