    3 tablespoons vegetable oil
    3 tablespoons unsalted butter
    2/3 cup popcorn kernels
    1/2 teaspoons kosher salt

1. Combine all ingredients in a medium heavy pot (preferably cast iron). Heat over high, stirring, until butter melts.
2. Cover, reduce heat to medium-high, and cook, undisturbed, until kernels begin popping rapidly. Offset lid to create a 1/8-inch vent along one side of pot; continue cooking until popping begins to subside, about 2 minutes.
3. Transfer popcorn to a large bowl; toss until cooled slightly, about 2 minutes. Serve.


SPICY MAPLE VARIATION 

1. Reduce butter to 2 tablespoons and salt to 1 teaspoon. 
2. Stir together 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, 1 tablespoon sugar, and a pinch of cayenne pepper; quickly add to pot once kernels begin to pop and shake vigorously a few times to evenly coat.
