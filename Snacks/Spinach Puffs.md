        2 (10 oz) packages frozen spinach, thawed, drained, and chopped
        6 oz feta cheese, crumbled (about 2 cups)
        3 large eggs
        1/2 c minced white onion
        1 Tbsp minced garlic
        1 Tbsp chopped fresh dill
        1 Tbsp chopped fresh thyme leaves
        Pinch of ground nutmeg

        1 sheet puff pastry (from 17.3 oz pack), thawed

2. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the puff pastry into a 14 in square. Cut the puff pastry into 4 equal strips, then cut the strips into 3 even rectangles. You should have 12 rectangles of dough.
3. Place each rectangle into the cup of a muffin tin, arranging the tips to they point up and out. Divide the spinach mixture evenly amongst the cups.
