4. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the ketchup, oyster sauce, sugar, and wocestershire.
5. Move the pan from the oven rack directly under the broiler and broil on high heat for 2-3 mins, or until the top gets golden brown and crispy.
6. Drizzle the finished Okonomiyaki with sauce from step 4, them mayo. Sprinkle with nori strips, sesame seeds, and scallions. Serve warm or room temperature.

Note: You can use a red cabbage in a pinch, but green cabbage has a better texture and color for this dish.
