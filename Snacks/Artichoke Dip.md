Ingredients:

  1 1/2 cups water
  1 cup drained canned artichoke hearts packed in water
  10 oz frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed to remove excess water
  8 oz regular or low fat cream cheese, at room temperature
  1/2 cup finely greated Parmigiano-Reggiano
  1 small shallot, minced
  1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
  1/2 tsp garlic powder
  1/2 tsp salt
  3/4 cup half-and-half or light cream
  Diced red onion, to garnish

  Optional: 2-3 slices of bacon, fried, patted dry, and chopped

  Method:

  1. Pour water into the IP insert. Set in the trivet rack.
  2. Squeeze the artichoke heart over the sink to remove excess moisture, then chop coarsely and add to a 7-in wide, high walled heatproof baking dish. Do the same with the spinach.
  3. Add the cream cheese, parm, shallot, bacon (if using), flour, garlic powder, and salt. Use a form to smash ingredients together until creamy. The texture should remain somewhat chunky.
  4. Stir in cream until well blended. Cover the dish gently with aluyminum foil, then place on top of trivet rack. Lock the lid onto the pot.
  5. Set cooker to Manual HIGH pressure and cook for 20 minutes. When the pot has completed the cycle, do a quick release. Carefully remove the inner dish and allow to cool for a few minutes.
