## Ingredients

* 3 cans of black beans (15 ounces each) or 4 ½ cups cooked black beans, rinsed and well-drained
* 2 ears of corn, shucked, or 1 cup of canned corn (drained) or defrosted frozen corn
* 1 orange, yellow or red bell pepper, chopped
* 1 cup quartered cherry tomatoes
* 1 cup chopped red onion (from 1 small onion)
* ½ cup finely chopped fresh cilantro (about ½ medium bunch)
* 1 medium jalapeño, finely chopped (keep the seeds for heat if you’d like, or remove them for mild flavor) or 2 tablespoons finely chopped pickled jalapeño
* ½ teaspoon lime zest (from 1 lime, preferably organic)
* 2 tablespoons lime juice (about 1 lime), to taste
* ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
* ¼ cup white wine vinegar
* ½ teaspoon chili powder
* ½ teaspoon ground cumin
* ½ teaspoon salt, to taste
* Optional garnishes: sliced avocado, crumbled feta, lime wedges

##Preparation

* In a large serving bowl, combine all of the ingredients and toss to combine. Taste, and adjust as necessary until the flavors really pop—I usually add another teaspoon or two of vinegar (you can use lime juice instead, for more mild flavor) and another ¼ teaspoon salt.

* Cover and chill to enhance the flavors—preferably for at least 2 hours, or overnight. Serve in individual bowls as is, or with any of the garnishes listed. Leftovers keep well for up to 4 days or so; you might want to wake up the flavors with an extra squeeze of lime juice or tiny splash of vinegar.
