    1 pound dried navy beans
    1 ham bone + ham scraps
    1 tablespoon olive oil
    1 large onion, peeled and chopped
    6 cloves garlic, minced
    1 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
    2 teaspoons ground cumin
    1/2-1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
    11 cups water
    Salt and pepper
    
    1.Place beans in water to cover, then cover and bring to a boil. Once the beans reach a full boil, turn off the pot and allow them to soak, covered for 45min-1 hour. Rinse before use.
    
    2.Place a large 6 quart pot over medium heat. Add the oil, onions, and garlic. Saut√© for 3-5 minutes to soften the onions.
    
    3.Then add in the drained beans, thyme, ground cumin, crushed red pepper, 10 cups of water, and any remaining ham scraps. (Do not salt the soup until the end, because ham bones can be very salty.)
    
    4.Bring the soup to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 60-90 minutes, covered, until the beans are very soft. Uncover and stir occasionally, then place the lid back on top.
    
    5.Use a fork to pull any remaining ham off the bone and stir it into the soup. Discard the bone. Add 1-2 cups additional water if the soup is too thick. Taste, then salt and pepper as needed.
