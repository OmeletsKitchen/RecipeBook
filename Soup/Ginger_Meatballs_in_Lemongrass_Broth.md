Serves 4.

For the broth:

    2 stalks lemongrass
    6 c chicken or vegetable broth
    1 tsp coriander seeds
    1 tsp cinnamon
    Soy sauce, to taste
    Fish sauce, to taste
    
For the meatballs:

    454g ground meat (pork, chicken, or beef)
    1 Tbsp minced ginger
    1 Tbsp sesame oil
    1 Tbsp soy sauce
    3 garlic cloves, minced
    1/2 tsp kosher salt
    
    200g rice vermicelli noodles
    1/2 c fresh mint, rinsed
    1/2 c fresh cilantro, rinsed
    Chili oil, for garnish
    
 1. Meatballs: To a large bowl, add meat, ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, garlic, and salt. Gently mix to combine. Form into meatballs, using about 2 tsp per ball.
 2. In a large, heavy bottomed pot, bring a bit of oil to medium-high heat, then add meatballs. Cook until browned on all sides, about 10min.
 3. Trim and peel lemongrass to remove tough outer layer. Smash lemongrass in thickest part with a pestle to release flavor. 
 4. To meatball pot, combine lemongrass, broth, coriander seeds, and cinnamon. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer until meatballs are thoroughly cooked, 10-12 mins.
 5. Meanwhile, bring a kettle of water to a boil. Place noodles in a medium heatproof bowl. Cover noodles with boiling water and set aside until softened, 10-15 mins. Stir ocassionally to ensure noodles remain submerged.
 6. To pot with broth, add a splash of soy and fish sauce, adjusting to taste.
 7. Divide drained, cooked noodles across 4 bowls and place 5 meatballs in each bowl. Ladle broth over meatballs. Roughly tear mint and cilantro and distribute across bowls. Serve chili oil alongside for guests to add as desired.
