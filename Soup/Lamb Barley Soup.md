    1 tsp olive oil
    200g lamb neck fillet, trimmed of fat and cut into small pieces. Sausage works great, too.
    1/2 large onion, finely chopped
    50g pearl barley
    600g mixed root vegetable (potato, parsnip, carrot)
    2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
    2 litres lamb or beef stock
    1 thyme sprig
    100g green beans, peas, or spinach, finely chopped

1. Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Season the lamb, then fry for a few mins until browned. 
2. Add the onion and barley, then gently fry for 1 min. Add the root veg, cook for 2 more mins, then add the Worcestershire sauce, stock and thyme. 
3. Cover, then simmer for 20 mins.
4. When everything is cooked, spoon about a quarter of the soup into a separate pan. Pur√©e with a stick blender (or put into a normal blender and whizz), then stir it back into the rest of the soup. 
5. Add the greens, simmer for 3 mins, then ladle the soup into bowls and serve with crusty bread.
