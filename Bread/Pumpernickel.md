# Pumpernickel Bread

**Makes one large loaf or two small loaves**

## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups (312.5 g) all-purpose flour
- 1 cup (127 g) bread flour
- 1 cup (102 g) medium rye flour
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 5 teaspoons instant yeast
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 ½ cups warm water, 105°F-115°F
- ½ cup (168.5 g) molasses
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

## Instructions

1. Spray a 9×5-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.
2. To a large bowl, add all-purpose flour, bread flour, rye flour, cocoa powder, yeast, sugar, and salt. Whisk to combine.
3. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, mix together the warm water, molasses, and vegetable oil.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Mix on low speed until a dough forms, 1-2 minutes.
5. Knead for 5-8 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Alternatively, you can turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and hand knead for about 8-10 minutes.
6. Place the dough in a large, clean, oiled bowl and cover. Let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 60-90 minutes.
7. Once the dough has risen, roll it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Flatten the dough into a rectangle, roughly the width of the loaf pan.
8. Starting at the short end, roll the dough tightly to form a log, pinching the seams as you go to create a tight surface.
9. Place the rolled dough seam-side down into the prepared pan.
10. Cover and let the dough rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
11. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C) as the dough completes its second rise.
12. Bake the loaf for about 50-55 minutes, or until the bread sounds hollow when tapped.
13. Remove the bread from the oven. Let it cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.
