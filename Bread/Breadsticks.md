For the Homemade Breadsticks:

    59 g warm water
    1 tbsp granulated sugar
    2Â½ tsp active dry yeast
    360 grams all-purpose flour
    237 ml hot water
    1 tsp salt
    
1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside. 

2. In a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup lukewarm (just barely above room temperature) water with the sugar and dry active yeast. Allow the mixture to bloom (foam) for 5-10 minutes. 

3. Meanwhile, in the bowl of an electric stand mixer add 2 cups flour and salt. Use the standard paddle attachment, not a bread hook. Turn on low and add very hot water. Mix to combine. 

4. Once the yeast is very foamy, pour it into the mixing bowl. Turn the mixer on and slowly add the last cup of flour. Let the mixer run until the dough is very smooth and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. 

5. Dump the dough out onto a floured work surface. It should be very soft and tacky. Cut the dough into quarters. Then cut each quarter into 3 equal pieces, to make 12 equal portions.

6. Use your hands to roll each piece of dough against the counter, into a long 10-inch rope. Gently move the dough ropes onto the baking sheets, leaving room in between for expansion. 

7. Once all the breadsticks are rolled out, place them in the oven for 12-14 minutes.

8. Brush with melted butter and garlic salt if desired.
