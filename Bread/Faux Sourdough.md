From: Oven to Table by Jan Scott

Ingredients:

    360 grams all-purpose flour
    1½ tsp kosher salt
    ¾ tsp instant/quick dry yeast
    237 ml warm water
    113 grams full fat greek yogurt
    1 tsp liquid honey

  
Method:


1. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine all ingredients. Using the paddle attachment, mix until dough is fully incorporated. The dough will be very wet and sticky, and may need a bit more flour depending on the humidity of your kitchen and the consistency of your yogurt. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temp for 2 hours or until it doubles in size.
2. Transfer bowl of dough to the refrigerator and let rest at least 8 hours.
3. Lightly flour a work surface and gently knead the dough a few times. Use a bench scraper to shape the dough into a ball and cover with your proofing bowl. Allow the dough to proof 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
4. As the dough rises, place a dutch oven and its lid in the oven and heat the oven to 450F, warming the pot in the process.
5. Once the oven is hot, transfer the proofed dough to a sheet of parchment paper and carefully drop all of it into the hot pot. Quickly slice the ball of dough with a sharp knife.
6. Cover the pot and bake for 30 min. Remove the lid and bake another 15-20 min, or until bread is crusty and brown on top.


When finished, transfer to a wire rack. Cool for 1 hour before slicing, for best texture.
